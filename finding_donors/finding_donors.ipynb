    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "Decision Trees:\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees algorithm can be used to recommend apps to different users in the app store. For example, we could rank/recommend social media app to users with various traits such as age, gender, location, previous app usage data etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strength of the decision tree lies in its simplicity. The model constantly look for ways to split the data to achieve maximum entropy difference before and after the split. As a side note, the decision boundary will always be parallel to the axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weakness of the model, however, is that it's prone to overfitting. To overcome this, we need to conduct gridsearch on multiple parameters (i.e. max tree depth, minimum sample split) to find the best parameter set. We might also want to prune the tree to overcome potential overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our problem on hand, we have a data set with 13 features, about 36K training sample points, and labled outcome. Therefore, it's well suited for an classification algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each person in the data set, we have a number of attributes (i.e. education num, age etc.). I expect some of these attributes will be good splitters to give good prediction result. For examples, using just education num and age as two features, I expect a person with high number of years of education and older to be more likely having income level of more than 50K. Therefore, a deicision tree algorithm will give a nice decision boundary and have high F-score. \n",
    "\n",
    "SVM:\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM can be used to find out a certain group of customer who is more likly to respond to a new product. For example, say we have a new product gearing towards people who travel often, but we can only purchase third party data to validate whether our customers are traveling or not, so we wish to develop and algorithm to predict given the attributes we have.\n",
    "\n",
    "The stock SVM algorithm finds linear deicision boundary that seperates the data. However, the strength of SVM is the flexiblity of the kernel trick, therefore it can handle both linear seperatble and linear non-seperable data with ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weakness of the model is its speed. SVM traning time can become huge when data size increases. Based on sklearn's note, the fit time complexity of the SVC implementation is more than quadratic and it's hard to scale to data set with more than a couple of 10K samples (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVC.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM is in the calssification algorithm family and therefore a candidate for our problem on hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, there are 13 features in our data set, therefore I expect the data to not be linear seperatable. However, using appropriate SVM kernal like rbf, we can effectively construct a nonlinear decision boundary for our data set and achieve high F-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression is a frequently used classification algorithm in industry. We can use such algorithm to produce go/no go decision. For example, in phamaceutical industry where we wish to model whether a drug candidate will pass  clinical trial. We can use a number of properties of the drug to predict the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strength of logistic regression is its simplicity. Mathmetically it has very similar philosophy as SVM. Logistic regression also has regularization terms to avoid overfitting. L1 regularization in particular, offers feature selection. Derived from linear regression, a unique feature of logistic regression is that it produces the probability of a data point that belongs to certain catogory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weakness of the model is it can only find a linear decision boundary, since it's derived from linear regression. Therefore, even at high dimensional hyperspace, the decision boundary is a hyperplane. This could be useful when applied to high dimensional data with fewer data points (the curse of dimensionality) as a high bias model is often desired in the situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is in the calssification algorithm family and therefore a candidate for our problem on hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though I do not expect the dataset to be linear seperatable, logistic regression is fast in training, easy to implement, and scale well to large data size for potential future business use. In addition, logistic regression can provide the probability index of whether an individual has earning more than 50K, which could also potentially benefit the business. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*additional comments\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees\n",
    "You're right that they can tend to suffer from over-fitting unless we're careful about tuning them. As you probably remember from the model validation project,the max_depth parameter can be a useful starting point for reducing overfitting.\n",
    "Another popular method is pruning:\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pruning_(decision_trees)\n",
    "Although pruning is not strictly supported in sklearn, tuning the min_impurity_splithyper-parameter serves is a great replacement.\n",
    "http://blog.nelsonliu.me/2016/08/05/gsoc-week-10-scikit-learn-pr-6954-adding-pre-pruning-to-decisiontrees/\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression\n",
    "You might find that it's difficult to get extra performance out of this model in the hyperparameter tuning phase. This is a consequence of the high-bias nature of the model. One workaround we can use is to perform some clever feature engineering. By creating new features that are non-linear combinations of existing features, we can allow logistic regression to learn more complex relationships in the data.\n",
    "You can use the PolynomialFeatures class in sklearn to do the legwork here."

    "**Answer: From the plots, it would seem that logistic regression is be the best performing algorithm here, due to the following three reasons. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, the out-of-the-box logistic regression algorithm does not overfit, at least not obvious. Judging from the learning curve (accuracy on traning and test set, logistic regression and SVM both converge well, with reasonable amount of error. On the other hand, Decision Trees algorithm clearly overfits the data, as the errors in the learning curve do not converge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the out-of-the-box logistic regression algorithm gives the highest F-score, the metric of interest, on the test set, out of the three algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, the out-of-the-box logistic regression algorithm has the fastest prediction time on all three sets of subset training data. While SVM gives reasonable F score on the testing set, its traning time is magnitudes slower compared to the other two algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note the training time plotted here is in actual time (seconds). Because SVM is so much slower compared to the other two algorithms, the training time for the other two algorithms do not show on the plot. To account for this, I suggest using log time (code provided)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, based on the additional tests I did, I found decision tree gives higher F score after parameter tuning. Here are the reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, logistic regression is designed to produce go/no go prediction (binary) on linear seperatable data. Our data set has 13 features, therefore it's unlikly to be linear seperatble. As a result logistic regression may not be the highest performing algorithm in terms of accuracy and f score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the stock decision tree algorithm clearly overfits, thus requires further tuning. Due to the structure of our data set, we should able to find some features that explains a lot of the variation in data, thus allows decision tree to achieve high accuracy and f socre. It's also likely that as we cap the tree depth and minimum split, the training time will decrease. Therefore, I decide to go with decision tree in the next section. **"

    "The decision tree classifier used here looks for features that best seperates the data into two groups. The features are the attributes of each person (i.e. sex, age, education years etc.), the two groups are income level greater than 50K and less than 50K. The algorithm works similar to the game 20 questions. Suppose we only have two features, age and education years. The best strategy would be ask whether a person is over 30 years old or not, if everyone who earn over 50K are over 30 years old. The next question is to ask whether a person received over 10 years of education, where supposly 10 years is a good seperator for people's income level. As a result, the model predicts everyone who is older than 30 and have received more than 10 years of education to have income more than 50K.\n",

    "This model works the best if there are a number of features in the data set that gives good seperation of the data, which seems to be the case in our problem on hand. Therefore, we want to further fine tuning the model on our data set.\n",

    "The logistic regression model employed here looks for a line (in 2D) and a hyperplane (in higher dimension) to seperate the data into two groups. The axes here are the attributes of each persion (i.e. sex, age, education years etc.), the two groups are income level greter than 50K and less than 50K. Supposly we only have two features, age and education years. The model will try to fit a line a*x_1 + b*x_2 + c to achieve best seperation of the data. A unique feature of logistic regression is that it produces the liklihood of a data point belonging to a group. In addition, the model runs very fast and easy to scale to large training set size.\n",

From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn.

    "**It's interesting to see that model on reduced data set gives more true positives but also almost twice as much as false positives. Overall, if traning time is a factor, I would adopt reduced data set approach, since F-score does not suffer greatly. However, if accuracy, particularly minimizing false positive is important (which is the rational behind choosing f-0.5 score in this work), I will train the model on full data set.** "
