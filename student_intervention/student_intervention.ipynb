The features are the attributes of each person (i.e. sex, age, education years etc.), the two groups are income level greater than 50K and less than 50K. The algorithm works similar to the game 20 questions. Suppose we only have two features, age and education years. The best strategy would be ask whether a person is over 30 years old or not, if everyone who earn over 50K are over 30 years old. The next question is to ask whether a person received over 10 years of education, where supposly 10 years is a good seperator for people's income level. As a result, the model predicts everyone who is older than 30 and have received more than 10 years of education to have income more than 50K.**\n",
